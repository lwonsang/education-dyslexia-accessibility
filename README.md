# education-dyslexia-accessibility
The goal of this app is to promote accessibility in education for students with learning disabilities such as dyslexia and CAPD (WORK IN PROGRESS).

This app's main functions are converting speech/audio files to text format and vice versa, whether it be from Text to Speech format (from scanning text, uploading text files such as pdfs, or simply inputting one's own text), Live Mic Transcription, or Speech to Text format (from uploading audio files). 

Resulting transcriptions can also be selected to play certain bits of text, and certain words can be selected to display images from an image bank to help the user visualize the words better. Users can adjust playback speed and font size in the settings.

Users can also save their files as a Study Note, allowing them to review their notes after use.
